## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

This repository contains a simple todo application built using Flutter and Hive database. Users can easily jot down tasks, mark them as complete, and delete tasks as needed. The interface is clean and intuitive, making task management a breeze. Whether you're organizing your daily to-dos or keeping track of long-term goals, this app provides a straightforward solution. Inspired by Mitch Kiko's tutorial on YouTube, this project serves as a learning experience for me in Flutter development.
