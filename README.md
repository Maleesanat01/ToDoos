  <h1>ToDoos: Tasks Made Simple</h1>
</p>

## Description
This repository contains a simple todo application built using Flutter and Hive database. Users can easily jot down tasks, mark them as complete, and delete tasks as needed. Inspired by Mitch Kiko's tutorial on YouTube, this project serves as a learning experience for me in Flutter development.
